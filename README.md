# 🌸 Patchwork: A Collaborative Emotional Quilt

Patchwork is a soothing digital space where people anonymously “sew” their emotions into a shared quilt using colored patches and AI-generated affirmations. It’s a calming, communal art experience powered by Python, Flask, WebSockets, and a sprinkle of emotional AI.
